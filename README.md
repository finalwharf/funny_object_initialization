# Funny Object Initialization

This sample shows how to (and how ***not*** to) do dynamic object initialization in Ruby.

| class        |  description         |
|--------------|----------------------|
| `GoodSample` | the good             |
| `BadSample`  | the bad and the ugly |
|              |                      |

To run the tests, use:

```bash
$ rake test
```
